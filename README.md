# motoHUDsch
KiCad Schematic and PCB for STM32-based motorcycle digital instrument cluster (software - https://github.com/wiciu15/motoHUDini).

1st revision of schematic had problems with thermals on 5V regulator, ADC accuracy and other brain farts like bad footprint or silkscreen marking

Rev2 comes with fixes(I hope) and some new features like button switches.

If you don't have/like KiCAD there are schematic PDFs and gerber files.
